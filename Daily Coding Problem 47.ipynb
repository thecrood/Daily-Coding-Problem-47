    "The maximum profit comes from the greatest difference between the highest price and lowest price, where the higher price must come after the lower one. But if we see a high price x and then a higher price y afterwards, then we can always discard x. So, if we keep track of the highest price in the future for each variable, we can immediately find how much profit buying at that price can make.\n",

Then, at each step, we can look at the current price and check how much profit we would have made buying at that price by comparing with our maximum price in the future. Then we only need to make one pass!\n",
